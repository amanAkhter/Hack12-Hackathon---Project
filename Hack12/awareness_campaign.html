  <p>
    Throughout 2018, we continued our work to raise awareness of thyroid disorders. At the global level, we supported the International Thyroid Awareness Week in May 2018 for the tenth time. This annual awareness campaign, which we run jointly with the Thyroid Federation International (TFI), aims to highlight some of the lesser-known aspects of thyroid disorders.

To mark this year’s International Thyroid Awareness Week, we commissioned an international survey, together with the TFI, among hypothyroidism patients in six countries. The results suggest that getting diagnosed can be difficult and distressing for many of those affected by thyroid disorders, with 70% of surveyed patients saying that they found the road to diagnosis stressful.

We hosted a number of our own events during the week, with more than half targeted specifically at healthcare professionals. These events connected us with almost 35,000 people, including around 11,000 healthcare professionals. Furthermore, we reached three million people through our own social media activities in 23 countries and an additional 35 million people were touched by news coverage, social media and events.

At the regional level, we launched an awareness and action campaign with the Vietnam National Hospital of Endocrinology, which highlighted the fact that although many women suffer from thyroid disorders, an estimated 50% go undiagnosed. The campaign offered free screening for thyroid diseases in 15 hospitals nationwide, with around 50,000 screenings taking place under the supervision and management of the Merck Vietnam representative office.

    Awareness campaigns for cancer
  </h2>
  <p>
    Each year in September, we support the Head and Neck Cancer Awareness Week, an initiative by the Make Sense Campaign that is run by the European Head and Neck Society (EHNS). We align with the Make Sense Campaign’s three-year theme, “Supporting Survivorship,” and demonstrate our commitment to the head and neck cancer community through our own “Stand Up for Survivors” campaign. Our publicity material included a video in which a head and neck cancer survivor discussed the challenges she faced during remission. Partners were encouraged to translate our materials and leverage them locally with stakeholders in their region. We also asked subsidiaries to show their solidarity with survivors by sharing photos on social media that showed them representing the key theme and standing up for survivors.

    Online diabetes campaign
  </h2>
  <p>
    According to the International Diabetes Federation, there were 14 million cases of diabetes in Africa in 2015, a figure expected to more than double by 2040. Moreover, approximately 60% of cases go undiagnosed. Awareness of early symptoms of diabetes is low, even among healthcare professionals. To improve early diagnosis and promote awareness of the disease, we joined forces with various partners in March 2015 to launch a digital initiative known as DORA (Diabetes Online Risk Assessment). DORA aims to expand individuals’ knowledge of diabetes by providing free online self-assessment tests to determine their risk of developing the disease. Depending on the outcome of the online test, people have the opportunity to take a free blood test in partnering pharmacies. When this blood test indicates diabetes, they are given a starter pack to help monitor the disease at home. Until recently, DORA had been deployed in Ethiopia, Ghana Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, and South Africa. During 2018, the program was extended to Angola, Botswana, Tanzania and Uganda. Since its launch, there have been more than one million visits to the DORA website.

    World Cancer Day
  </h2>
  <p>
    On February 4, 2018, we again recognized World Cancer Day, an annual initiative driven by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). This year, we focused on the future possibilities of cancer care with our campaign “We Can. I Can. Help Shape the Future for Patients.” Teams from around the world got creative, expressing their hopes and aspirations for the future of cancer care through sculptures made from modelling clay. We received almost 330 images of support from 24 countries and our multi-channel social media activity generated over 15,300 views.

  <p>
    During March 2018, we backed Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Awareness Month, an initiative to raise awareness of CRC, its symptoms and the importance of early diagnosis. Our “gut strength: Targeting CRC Together” campaign encompassed three key themes: together, strength and support. We united on social media to share a message of support through a Thunderclap, which reached over 162,000 people worldwide. Colleagues also showed their commitment to the CRC community by sharing photos of themselves visually representing the key themes and using the campaign hashtag #gutstrength.

    World Multiple Sclerosis Day
  </h2>
  <p>
    Annual World Multiple Sclerosis Day (WMSD) in May 2018. This year’s theme was #bringinguscloser to ending multiple sclerosis (MS), which was selected to celebrate advancements in research and care and to look to the future for further developments. A total of 26 Merck organizations participated in this initiative of the MS International Federation (MSIF) by showcasing their support and activities.

We also announced a new campaign, #MSInsideOut, to support the MS community and deepen understanding of the disease. The initiative involved a collaboration with the social network Shift.ms, which acted as executive producers of a new documentary, “Interpreting MS”, which featured unique perspectives from people with MS. The documentary premiered at the 34th Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in Berlin (Germany) in October 2018.

To accompany the premiere of the documentary, we published the report “Living with Multiple Sclerosis: The Carer’s Perspective”, which examines the experiences of those caring for people living with MS. This report was developed in collaboration with the International Alliance of Carer Organizations (IACO) and Eurocarers, the European network that represents informal carers and their organizations. A survey of MS carers across seven countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States) found that almost half of those surveyed became carers when they were 34 years old or younger, and one in three had been caring for somebody for 11 years or more. Furthermore, nearly half reported that their caring responsibilities had negatively impacted their future plans and life goals, while a similar proportion said they suffered from either severe or high stress levels. This emotional toll was compounded by the fact that over half of the carers surveyed felt that people around them don’t truly understand what it means to care for someone with MS. Finally, MS in the 21st Century, an initiative sponsored by our company, launched a website for discussions between patients and healthcare professionals.

  <p>
    Since 2015, Merck has championed World Malaria Day, held annually on April 25, with campaigns that raise awareness for the disease and through engaging in the activities and efforts of the “One Merck for Malaria” program. In 2018, we hosted events in Accra (Ghana), joining forces with the Infanta Malaria Prevention Foundation of the First Lady of Ghana and with ASPIRx to support the Ghanaian National Malaria Control Program. These events, which included a scientific symposium, led to the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for a consortium to identify and deploy timely and effective malarial prevention solutions for vulnerable populations.

  <p>
    A global campaign was launched for World Diabetes Day on November 14, 2018, under the concept: See it. Slow it. Stop it. The aim of the campaign is threefold: helping people spot the risks and symptoms of type 2 diabetes, empowering them take action to slow down progression to type 2 diabetes and ultimately equipping them to help themselves or others prevent type 2 diabetes. We continued our partnership with the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), working on a range of educational activities that aim to raise awareness of prediabetes and diabetes prevention and to globally reduce the rise in type 2 diabetes cases.
