  <p>
    Healthcare is fragmented, and this adversely impacts quality, cost, and outcomes. For example, doctors and practitioners typically don’t have knowledge of each other’s medicines and the broad range of treatments available. Additionally, due to the rapid growth of technology and online resources, the amount of health information has increased exponentially. The abundance of information available has made it much more difficult to find the information you need. Knowing who to trust in a sea of commercial health resources can seem almost impossible.

    These are significant problems, and that’s what HHP’s Real-World Data program is about. We provide independent, unbiased information from our community, including all types of medicines, to help you make informed healthcare decisions. Participate by sharing your experiences or learning about how others manage their health conditions.

    What HHP's Members Are Saying
  </h2>
  <p>
    In 2016, HHP launched the first real-world data survey on migraine headaches. Since then, over 13,000 survey respondents have contributed to HHP’s Migraine Headache Survey, and the survey results and graphical reports have had almost 400,000 pageviews. The most recent feedback has been outstanding, with over 80% of survey respondents reporting the data was easy to navigate and well organized. More than 70% reported that they would recommend the data to friends or family who are experiencing migraines. More than half of migraine survey respondents said they would use the migraine data to help themselves or someone they care for.

Most notably, after viewing the migraine survey data, respondents who reported their understanding of migraine headaches as excellent, very good, or good increased by almost 20%. An increase of over 23% was observed in respondents who reported their understanding of migraine treatments as excellent, very good, or good. Lastly, respondents who reported their understanding of migraine causes and triggers as excellent, very good, or good increased by 14%.

In 2017, HHP introduced the HHP Lupus Survey. To date, our lupus data has had over 25,000 pageviews, and continues to grow. We are extremely grateful to all our members who contributed to the Migraine and Lupus Surveys to provide useful information to others and help make the Real-World Data program a continued success.
